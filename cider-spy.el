;; other etc.

;; # Installation
;;
;; ## Prerequisites
;;
;; You need the [`CIDER-SPY-NREPL`](https://github.com/jonpither/cider-spy-nrepl)
;; middleware. See installation instructions there.

;; ## Basic configuration
;;
;; It's available on [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):
;;
;;     M-x package-install cider-spy
;;
;; You can also install the dependencies on your own, and just dump
;; clj-refactor in your path somewhere:
;;
;;  - <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a>
;;  - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">cider</a>
;;
;; # Setup
;;
;;     (require 'cider-spy)
;;
;; All actions in `CIDER-SPY` are triggered from the `CIDER-SPY` summary page.
;; To access the summary page:
;;
;;     M-x cider-spy-summary
;;
;; It can be useful to setup a global binding for the summary page for frequent
;; access, such as <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>.

;; ## Configuration for the HUB

;; If you want the developer interactivity behavours then you need a run a `CIDER-SPY-HUB`.
;; See the documentation for how to set one up.
;;

;; # Keyboard Shortcuts
;;
;; These shortcuts are available on the `CIDER-SPY` summary buffer:
;;
;;  - `g` : Refresh the `*cider-spy*` buffer
;;  - `r` : Reset the tracking data underpinning the `*cider-spy*` buffer
;;  - `n` : Goto to next section
;;  - `p` : Goto to previous section
;;  - `a` : Set `CIDER-SPY-HUB` alias
;;  - `s` : Send message to another dev (when cursor is on a dev)
;;  - `w` : Watch another devs REPL session (when cursor is on a dev)
;;  - `d` : Disconnect from the `CIDER-SPY-HUB`
;;  - `RETURN` : Visit section
;;  - `TAB` : Toggle section visibility
