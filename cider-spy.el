;; Current thinking (with kids in a coffee shop, never a good time_
;;  CIDER-SPY in emacs should control hub connection behavour.
;;  This way it's more transparent and configurable, and less complex
;;  It also makes cider-nrepl-server dumber.
;;  I'll need to handle the user bombarding the server with connection requests,
;;  perhaps only ensure one is in progress at any one time..
;;  One ideas is that server keeps trying if this connect-command is run.
;;  TODO - probably not a popup buffer, more of a background buffer
;;  TODO - test the error handling - be quite nice to report mal-connection there
