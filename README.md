# CIDER Spy

Spy on CIDER nREPL sessions

## Purpose

To help developers and teams share information about development flows.

## TODOS

* Remove junk from function calls if possible
* Ability to clear/reset the spy buffer
* Namespaces/hunks should be links
* Functions run most often outside of immediate namespace
* Functions run that fail most often
* Time Fns: https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/477.

## Abstract Directions

* Could actually be useful as a "learnt" project navigation tool
* I spent x amount of time in this namespace today
* track a users journey

## Ver 2

### Connected REPL sessions

* Connected repl sessions - i.e. send someone some code
* Dev x has been on this file.. etc etc.
* Popup some code in a buffer on another devs emacs
* Where is everyone right now? (project specific)
